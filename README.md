## Details about the main components and project.
I made the whole page from several components as it was in the figma. Components: navbar, footer, news block, promotional block, hot products block, catalog block, reviews block.
There are also two components such as a review card and a product card that can be easily used many times.
For each component, I used a different scss file.
In the components folder, there is a folder for each of them with their index.js and style.scss files, all component blocks are then imported into pages/mainPage

## after git clone https://github.com/ScarWxlf/test-task.git

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
